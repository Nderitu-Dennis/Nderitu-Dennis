 *At some point, I accidentally wandered into the clouds...*  
 
Now my [Credly](https://www.credly.com/users/dennis-nderitu) is suspiciously full of **AWS** and **GCP** badges.  
So yeah — I *know a thing or two* about the cloud, containers, and occasionally yelling at **Docker** and **Kubernetes** (some call it k8s to sound cool).  

 *During my industrial attachment at* **Swahilipot Hub Foundation**,  
I toyed with with **React**, **Next.js**, and even some **Python Django**.  

 *Python and I have an on-again, off-again thing.*  
 
We first met while drawing pixels with **Bresenham’s Algorithm** in a Computer Graphics class,  
and later reconnected in **Natural Language Processing**, which I actually enjoyed.  
Maybe one day I’ll venture deeper into **AI** — who knows?  
But for now, **Java still has my heart.** ❤️

🧠 *Fun fact:* Java is named after an island in Indonesia —  
and funny enough, **Lombok** (yes, the Java library) is also an island nearby.

Thanks for dropping by.
